# The project

This is a pre-alpha version of the "etytree" project. This project has been inspired by my interest in etymology, in open source collaborative projects and in interactive visualizations. 


## The visualization tool: etytree
The aim of the project is to visualize in an interactive web page the etymological tree (i.e., the etymology of a word in the form of a tree, with ancestors, cognate words, derived words, etc.) of any word in any language using data available in Wiktionary. The visualization tool is in folder etytree.


## The Wiktionary extraction tool: dbnary
This tool is an extension of http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/ and automatically extract etymological relationships from Wiktionary
