Extended Wordnet Support's Command Line Interface

* Creating a Lexical Network Based on Extended Wordnet 

%{toc|section=0|fromDepth=2|toDepth=3}

** Mapping WN20 ids to WN21 ids

  We want WordNet 2.1 ids in our lexical network, so that we are compatible with Penang's experiments. The id we want consists in a digit reflecting the POS (1 for noun, ...)
  concatenated with a 8 digit synset id of WordNet 2.1.
  
  Extended wordnet uses WordNet 2.0 ids. To associate the correct WN21 id to synsets of extended wordnet, we use the definition text as a common pivot between the 2 wordnets.
  
  The command line XWN20to21Adapter takes 2 parameters, the ewn wordnet xml file plus a def -> WN21 id mapping file.
  
  It produces an equivalent Extended wordnet xml file with WN21 synsetids.  

*** Format of the def-WN21 mapping file

   Describe the file format.
  
   Where do we find this file in WN21 archive ?
   
** Creating the lexical network

   Describe the other command lines and give examples.
