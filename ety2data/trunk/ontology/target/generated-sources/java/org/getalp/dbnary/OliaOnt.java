    /** <p>Clause is the class of constructions that form minimal sentential units. They 
     *  must include a predicate, all arguments of the predicate, and all modifiers 
     *  of the predicate and the arguments. (http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Clause)Traditionally 
     *  sentences are deemed to be composed of major constituents known as clauses, 
     *  which may be main clauses (not included in a superordinate clause) or embedded 
     *  clauses (included in a superordinate clause) such as relative clauses or adverbial 
     *  clauses. A main clause, unless it is coordinated, is equivalent to a simple 
     *  sentence, and does not need to be separately labelled. Embedded and coordinated 
     *  clauses, on the other hand, will need to be separately identified. We recommend 
     *  that such units be identified in the annotation, and labelled either as sentences 
     *  (S) or as clauses (CL), according to the preference specified in the annotation 
     *  scheme. The reason for allowing choice here is that different theoretical 
     *  preferences have to be accommodated. In some syntactic models, the `clause' 
     *  category is not used (except informally), embedded clauses being marked by 
     *  included [S] constituents. In other models, clauses are identified as such, 
     *  even where they are coextensive with an independent sentence. One solution 
     *  which commends itself (and is employed in the Lancaster Treebank and the SUSANNE 
     *  Corpus) is to retain [S ... S] as the delimiter of sentences, whether included 
     *  or not, and also to use [S ... S] for the coordinated parts of a compound 
     *  sentence; but to use `clause' labels for subordinate clauses. An example which 
     *  illustrates this division is 12: (12) [S [S The distinction at issue is relatively 
     *  clear S] , but [S closer examination reveals [CL that all is not quite so 
     *  straightforward [CL as it seems CL] CL] S] . S] Embedded (subordinate) clauses 
     *  are generally identified by some sign of their dependence on the superordinate 
     *  clause or sentence, such as an introductory conjunction or a non-finite verb 
     *  form. It is noticeable that the coordinated parts of the compound sentence 
     *  do not have to be clause-like units with subjects and verbs, and to this extent 
     *  [CL] would be a misleading label to apply to them. This is true, in 13, of 
     *  so far so good in: (13) [S [S So far so good S] , but [S now consider gender 
     *  in adjectives S] . S] (http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node31.html)</p>

     *  head or primary component of the compound, which may be a verb or noun (V+V 
     *  or V+N compounds). Other names for "light verb" include: vector verb or explicator 
     *  verb, emphasising its role within the compound; or thin verb or semantically

     *  weak" verb is not to be confused with a "weak verb" as in the Germanic weak

    /** <p>At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the 
     *  categories to be dealt with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or 
     *  a pronoun as its head, and included within the noun phrase are the determinative 
     *  elements, any premodification, and any postmodification. The examples below, 
     *  14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold: (14) [NP He 
     *  NP] was a tiny man (15) [NP his white shirt cuffs NP] (16) [NP his surprisingly 
     *  thick and hairy wrists NP] (17) [NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely 
     *  possible event of absorbing interest NP] However, noun phrases may also occur 
     *  with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19: (18) [NP The unemployed NP] have had 
     *  enough (19) We've beaten [NP the best NP] or with a head which is a cardinal 
     *  or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21: (20) [NP The ninth NP] is my particular 
     *  favourite (21) [NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip In `pro-drop' 
     *  languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not 
     *  expressed. Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another 
     *  definition of noun phrase, in order to include `empty noun phrases', in which 
     *  the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred from the verb ending. 
     *  A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be 
     *  moved within the same sentence. In English, constituents can be preposed to 
     *  achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70): (22) I can't stand 
     *  your elder sister (23) Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's 
     *  OK). Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of 
     *  the NP: (24) *Your elder I can't stand sister (25) *Elder sister, I can't 
     *  stand your However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in 
     *  English, but not always in other languages. For example, in 26 Neue Bücher 
     *  is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end: 
     *  (26) Neue Bücher habe ich keine new books have I no `I have not got any new 
     *  books' (http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node32.html)NounPhrase is

    /** <p>Noun denoting spatial and temporal expressions "A tag NST has been included 
     *  to cover an important phenomenon of Indian languages. Certain expressions 
     *  such as 'Upara' (above/up), 'nIce' (below) 'pahale' (before), 'Age' (front) 
     *  etc are content words denoting time and space. These expressions, however, 
     *  are used in various ways. For example, 5.1.2.1 These words often occur as 
     *  temporal or spatial arguments of a verb in a given sentence taking the appropriate 
     *  vibhakti (case marker): h3. vaha Upara so rahA thA . 'he' 'upstairs' 'sleep' 
     *  'PROG' 'was' “He was sleepign upstairs”. h4. vaha pahale se kamare meM bEThA 
     *  thA . 'he' 'beforehand' 'from' ' room' 'in' 'sitting' 'was' “He was sitting 
     *  in the room from beforehand” h5. tuma bAhara bETho 'you' 'outside' 'sit' “You 
     *  sit outside”. Apart from functioning like an argument of a verb, these elements 
     *  also modify another noun taking postposition 'kA'. h6. usakA baDZA bhAI Upara 
     *  ke hisse meM rahatA hE 'his' 'elder' 'brother' 'upstairs' 'of' 'portion' 'in' 
     *  'live' 'PRES' “His elder brother lives in the upper portion of the house”. 
     *  5.1.2.2 Apart from occuring as a nominal expression, they also occur as a 
     *  part of a postposition along with 'ke'. For example, h7. ghaDZe ke Upara thAlI 
     *  rakhI hE. 'pot' 'of' 'above' 'plate' 'kept' 'is' The plate is kept on the 
     *  pot”. h8. tuma ghara ke bAhara bETho 'you' 'home' 'of' 'outside' 'sit' “You 
     *  sit outside the house”. 'Upara' and 'bAhara' are parts of complex postpositions 
     *  'ke Upara' and 'ke bAhara' in (h6) and (h7) respectively which can be translated 
     *  into English prepositions 'on' and 'outside'. For tagging such words, one 
     *  possible option is to tag them according to their syntactic function in the 
     *  given context. For example in 5.2.2 (h7) above, the word 'Upara' is occurring 
     *  as part of a postposition or a relation marker. It can, therefore, be marked 
     *  as a postposition. Similarly, in 5.2.1. (h3) and (h6) above, it is a noun, 
     *  therefore, mark it as a noun and so on. Alternatively, since these words are 
     *  more like nouns, as is evident from 5.2.1 above they can be tagged as nouns 
     *  in all there occurrences. The same would apply to 'bAhAra' (outside) in examples 
     *  examples (h4), (h5) and (h8). However, if we follow any of the above approaches 
     *  we miss out on the fact that this class of words is slightly different from 
     *  other nouns. These are nouns which indicate 'location' or 'time'. At the same 
     *  time, they also function as postpositions in certain contexts. Moreover, such 
     *  words, if tagged according to their syntactic function, will hamper machine 
     *  learning. Considering their special status, it was considered whether to introduce 
     *  a new tag, NST, for such expressions. The following five possibilities were 
     *  discussed : a) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NN b) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) 
     *  as NST c) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as NST d) Tag (h5) as NST &amp; (h8) as 
     *  PSP e) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as PSP After considering all the above, the 
     *  decision was taken in favour of (b). The decision was primarily based on the 
     *  following observations: (i) 'bAhara' in both (h5) and (h8) denotes the same 
     *  expression (place expression 'outside') (ii) In both (h5) and (h8), 'bAhara' 
     *  can take a vibhakti like a noun ( bAhara ko bETho, ghara ke bAhara ko bETho) 
     *  (iii) If a single tag is kept for both the usages, the decision making for 
     *  annotators would also be easier. Therefore, a new tag NST is introduced for 
     *  such expressions. The tag NST will be used for a finite set of such words 
     *  in any language. For example, Hindi has Age (front), pIche (behind), Upara 
     *  (above/upstairs), nIce (below/down), bAda (after), pahale (before), andara 
     *  (inside), bAhara (outside) etc." (Akshar Bharati, Dipti Misra Sharma, Lakshmi 
     *  Bai, Rajeev Sangal (2006), AnnCorra : Annotating Corpora. Guidelines For POS 
     *  And Chunk Annotation For Indian Languages, Tech. Rep., L anguage Technologies 
     *  Research Centre IIIT, Hyderabad, version of 15-12-2006, http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/tr031/posguidelines.pdf)NLOC 
     *  Noun Location This is an entirely new tag introduced to cover an important 
     *  phenomenon of Indian Languages. Words like 'Age', 'upara', 'pahele', 'bAda', 
     *  etc. are used in various ways in Hindi. 1. They act as a postposition along 
     *  with 'ke' e.g. ghade ke upara thAlI rakhI HE. ("pot" "on" "plate" "kept" "is") 
     *  Here 'ke upara' is a post position which is the direct equivalent of the English 
     *  preposition 'on'. 2. They also act as adverbs. e.g. tuma upara jAo. ("You" 
     *  "up" "go") Here 'upara' is an adverbial of place. 3. These words also take 
     *  post positions themselves and so in some sense behave like nouns. e.g. vaHa 
     *  upara se AyA. ("He" "above" "from" "came") 4. As pointed out in 3. above, 
     *  these words take postpositions and act as arguments of the verb in the sentence. 
     *  And they also take a post position to join with a another noun. So in that 
     *  sense also they behave like nouns. e.g. upara kA HissA ("above" "of" "portion") 
     *  To tag such words one option is to tag them according to the category to which 
     *  they belong in the given sentence. For example in 1. above, the word is occurring 
     *  as a postposition so can be marked as a postposition. In example 2. above, 
     *  it is an adverb so can be marked as an adverb and so on. But we feel that 
     *  these words are more like nouns as is evident from 3. and 4. above, and also 
     *  if we consider for examples, 'aage', 'upara', etc. as places which are in 
     *  front, up, etc then we can tag them as nouns. But these are not pure nouns. 
     *  They are nouns which indicate a location or time. These also function as adverbs 
     *  or prepositions in a context. So a new tag NLOC is introduced for such words. 
     *  This tag will cater to a finite set of such words. set: (Age, piche, upara, 
     *  nIce, bAda, pahele) ("front", "behind", "above", "below", "before") Such words 
     *  if tagged according to their syntactic function, it will hamper machine learning. 
     *  So a single tag, NLOC has been devised for such words which indicate location 
     *  and time. e.g., (upara, Age, pahele, bAda) (IIIT (2007), A Part of Speech 
     *  Tagger for Indian Languages (POS tagger), Tagset developed at IIIT - Hyderabad 
     *  after consultations with several institutions through two workshops. available

    /** <p>This category is slightly more difficult to define, since there is disagreement

     *  include only the words that are verbs, or should it also include the complements 
     *  of the verb? In the examples given in this document, and in the sample texts 
     *  in the appendices, we have chosen to include the complements, but it must 
     *  be noted that this is an open issue, and we are in no way implying that this 
     *  analysis is preferable to the alternative. The choice to be made at this level, 
     *  i.e. the inclusion or exclusion of verbal complements in the Verb Phrase, 
     *  is shown by the examples in 27 and 28, 27 showing the inclusion of the complement 
     *  of the verb in the verb phrase and 28 excluding the complement: (27) He [VP 
     *  took up [NP a clothes brush NP] VP] (28) He [VP took up VP] [NP a clothes 
     *  brush NP] An advantage in the type of analysis shown in 27 is that the relative 
     *  levels of the constituents can be shown to a greater extent -- i.e. complements 
     *  of the verb are included in the verb phrase, while adjuncts and peripheral 
     *  adverbials are left at sentence level. However, in a case where an adjunct 
     *  occurs before the complement of the verb, the approaches used in 27 and 28 
     *  would cause problems, since either both the adjunct and the complement would 
     *  be included as daughters of the verb phrase, or both would be daughters of 
     *  the sentence, rather than keeping the complement as a daughter of the verb 
     *  phrase and the adjunct as a sister of the verb phrase. These problems may 
     *  be solved by an additional notation, but at some level, arbitrariness is inevitable. 
     *  Regardless of the choice made over the extent of the Verb Phrase, there arises 
     *  a problem of discontinuous Verb Phrases. A complex verbal construction may 
     *  be discontinuous, e.g. the auxiliary and the main verb are separated in inverted 
     *  constructions in English, or the main verb is positioned at the end of the 
     *  sentence in German and Dutch. Such discontinuity can be avoided by having 
     *  different labels and constituents for the auxiliary verb and the main verb, 
     *  resulting in an analysis as shown in the Dutch example 29 below: (29) [NP 
     *  Ze NP] [AUX zullen AUX] [ADVP er ADVP] [VP [NP de VN-agenda [PP voor [NP het 
     *  komende jaar NP] PP] NP] behandelen VP]. and in the English interrogative 
     *  inverted example 30, using the so-called `dummy auxiliary' do: (30) [AUX Do 
     *  AUX] [NP they NP] [VP confide [PP in you PP] VP]? As with Noun Phrases, Verb 
     *  Phrases can be identified by a constituency test. In strong constituency languages 
     *  like English, the whole VP can be moved, but not part of it: compare 31 and 
     *  32: (31) Give in to blackmail, I never will (32) *Give in, I never will to 
     *  blackmail However, there are languages in which constituent tests do not work. 
     *  These will typically be languages with flexible word order, such as Finnish. 
     *  33 is an example of a discontinuous VP (Vilkuna 1989: 26): (33) Maailmaa nähnyt 
     *  hän on. world-Part seen he is `He IS a widely-travelled person.' For Finnish, 
     *  then, evidence for a VP is less convincing than it is for English, and a dependency 
     *  approach seems the more natural choice. (Covington (1990) provides a parsing 
     *  strategy for variable word order languages and Covington (1991) for parsing 
     *  discontinuous constituents, both using a dependency syntax approach.) In Italian 
     *  also, constituency tests cannot be applied. This can be shown through the 
     *  distribution of VP-adverbs (e.g. completamente `completely', intenzionalmente 
     *  `intentionally', attentamente `carefully') and S-adverbs (e.g. probabilmente 
     *  `probably', certamente `certainly'). In English, these different classes of 
     *  adverbs have a different distribution within the sentence. In contrast, in 
     *  Italian, the distinct adverb classes cannot be distinguished on the basis 
     *  of their distribution in the sentence. S-adverbs and VP-adverbs can occur 
     *  in the same positions within the sentence, as illustrated in examples 34 to 
     *  37: (34) Attentamente/certamente, il bambino ascoltó la storia `Carefully/certainly, 
     *  the child listened to the story' (35) Il bambino attentamente/certamente ascoltó 
     *  la storia `The child carefully/certainly listened to the story' (36) Il bambino 
     *  ascoltó attentamente/certamente la storia `The child listened carefully/certainly 
     *  to the story' (37) Il bambino ascoltó la storia attentamente/certamente `The 
     *  child listened to the story carefully/certainly' Thus, in Italian as well 
     *  as other languages, neither the position nor the syntactic context can help 
     *  to decide whether an adverb is an S-adverb or a VP-adverb; this can only be 
     *  stated by considering its semantic content and the way it relates to the content 
     *  of the predicate or the sentence. This situation has consequences for the 
     *  success of standard VP-tests. (http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node33.html)VerbPhrase
